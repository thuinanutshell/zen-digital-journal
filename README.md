# Zen - Reflective Daily Journal

## Problem Statement

**Zen** is a reflective journal for practicing mindfulness (i.e., observing thoughts and experiences daily) and better understanding oneself by extracting patterns from users’ own journal entries. The human brain undergoes a data-generating process every day. These thoughts or records of thoughts can tell us a lot about ourselves, hence helping us become more self-aware in different aspects of life.

There are different ways to record this data, often by writing or digital journaling. Either way has its own limitations because it is very hard to process a massive amount of data, and sometimes also because of inconsistent recording, which makes the conclusion biased. **Zen** addresses these problems by encouraging a daily log of users’ thoughts and emotions as well as utilizing AI for pattern extraction.
